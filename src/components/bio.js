Southside Atlanta native Joshua Hines, better known as JoélGotNow, is a trailblazing artist defying the norms of contemporary R&B with a style of his own creation - Lost Soul Music. His influences range from Prince & Whitney Houston to Miguel and 90's/2000-era classics; infusing layered, urgent lyrics with emotion and purpose. 

His path was cemented in 2018 following the death of his grandmother. He saw her in a dream, and she told him to pursue a career in music. He's never looked back since. Pain, pleasure and sincerity define his sound...ambition and consistency define his future.

JoélGotNow released his label debut WYA? (Prod. Antman) in January 2021.
